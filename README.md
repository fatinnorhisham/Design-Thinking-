# Design Thinking
# Reflection

Working on the **Digital Healthcare and Appointment System for UTM Students** has been a valuable learning experience. By applying the **Design Thinking process**, our team was able to empathize with real student needs, define clear problem statements, ideate practical solutions, prototype interfaces, and test usability with feedback.

## Key Learnings
- **User-Centered Design**: I realized that effective system design must balance usability, security, scalability, and reliability. Listening to user pain points (long queues, unclear waiting times, lack of appointment booking) shaped our solution.
- **Collaboration**: Each member contributed unique strengths—research, prototyping, testing, and coordination. This teamwork ensured the project stayed structured and student-focused.
- **Practical Skills**: I gained hands-on experience in UX design and prototyping using Figma, while also learning how to integrate feedback into iterative improvements.

## Personal Growth
As a Computer Networks and Security student, this project taught me:
- To **combine technical skills with usability** for impactful solutions.
- To approach problems systematically while remaining adaptable to user needs.
- That continuous learning and building practical projects are essential for growth in the IT industry.

## Future Application
I will apply these lessons by:
- Designing systems that prioritize both **security and user experience**.
- Building more prototypes to strengthen my UI/UX skills.
- Preparing for real-world roles such as **Network Engineer, Security Analyst, or System Administrator** by balancing technical expertise with user-centered thinking.
